Before you start working on this exercise, it is essential that you *understand* the first chapter of the book and the following pseudo-code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Initially all m ∈ M and w ∈ W are free\n",
    "While there is a man m who is free and hasn’t proposed to\n",
    "every woman\n",
    "    Choose such a man m\n",
    "    Let w be the highest-ranked woman in m’s preference list\n",
    "        to whom m has not yet proposed\n",
    "    If w is free then\n",
    "        (m, w) become engaged\n",
    "    Else w is currently engaged to m'\n",
    "        If w prefers m' to m then\n",
    "            m remains free\n",
    "        Else w prefers m to m'     \n",
    "            (m, w) become engaged\n",
    "            m' becomes free\n",

    "Return the set S of engaged pairs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see the code is quite extensive, but let's break it down into bitable chunks:\n",
    "We will start with the required data types, first lets define our dataset for this example:\n",
